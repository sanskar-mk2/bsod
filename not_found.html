<!--Yeah, uh. this one has the Lain soundtrack on it. It's a good show. hell, that's how this whole webring came to be. Just a bunch of dudes who like Lain in a discord server. I know. Discord. Shit on me all you want, but it's the path of least resistance. I think they have a forum thing on there now. I can't imagine it's any good. I think the only forums I use in any real capacity are ARFCOM and Agora. Man. The age of the forum. That was a good time. I hope that comes back. This pseudo-webring is oldweb-ish. It's not really a webring because I didn't want people to have some massive fuck off widget on their site like other webrings require. Just a main site, ya know?-->
